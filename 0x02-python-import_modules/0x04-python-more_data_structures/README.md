Tasks

0. Squared simple
mandatory
____________
Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):

matrix is a 2 dimensional array

Returns a new matrix:

Same size as matrix

Each value should be the square of the value of the input

Initial matrix should not be modified

You are not allowed to import any module

You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc

1. Search and replace
mandatory
__________
Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):

my_list is the initial list_

search is the element to replace in the list

replace is the new element
